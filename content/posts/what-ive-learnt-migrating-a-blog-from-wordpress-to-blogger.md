As per the subject, migrating a blog from Wordpress to Blogger isn't as hard as most would have imagined, On the down side, it's a bit tedious if you have stored your images with your Wordpress blog. For my case, I have always stored my images on Picasa Web, so, I need not go through the process of copying the images out from the Wordpress blog.

Here's the straight forward process of exporting your Wordpress blog into Blogger.

1.  From Wordpress, go to **Tools > Export, Download Export File**
2.  On Blogger, **Settings > Other > Blog tools > Import Blog**

That's about it.

With your blog posts, comments and categories (this will be converted to tags), and tags imported, you might have to go through each of your posts to do some clean up. Take note that the Category concept does not exists in Blogger. If you need to put your posts under a category, you would have to substitute it with a tag.

One other thing. Blogger does not have a .htaccess like how you would have it in Wordpress. If you need to redirect your old URLs to the new ones, you can achieve it by going to **Settings > Search preferences > Errors and redirections > Custom Redirects**.
